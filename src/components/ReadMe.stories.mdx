### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

```javascript
import { Button, Badge, Icon } from '@ebs-integrator/react-ebs-ui';
```

and use them like so

const Example: React.FC = () => (
  <>
    <Button type="primary" size="large">
      Do something
    </Button>

    <Badge count={1}>
      <Icon component={IconSVG} />
    </Badge>
