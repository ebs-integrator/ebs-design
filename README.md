## üî• Motivation

First of all, **ebs-design** started as an internal tool to be a single pattern for enterprise application development, improving the experience of users in our products by using enhanced components. Now designers and developers use the same style for applications such as Administration panels, CRMs, HRMs, Finance and Accounting Apps, Analytics Dashboards, etc. 

We are focused on creating rich components like forms, tables, modals, etc that add an exceptional experience in the most sophisticated apps.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

The UI Kit is UNDER DEVELOPMENT, we don't recommend using it in production projects until at least RC will be released. We are working on improving and refactoring. If you find  a problem, please create an Issue or PR with your change, will be glad to help.
